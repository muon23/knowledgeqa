      "[{'text': \"M-137 was a state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan that served as a spur route to the Interlochen Center for the Arts and Interlochen State Park. It started south of the park and ran north between two lakes in the area and through the community of Interlochen to US Highway 31 (US 31) in Grand Traverse County. The highway was first shown without a number label on maps in 1930 and labeled after an extension the next year. The highway's current routing was established in the 1950s. Jurisdiction of the roadway was transferred from the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) to the Grand Traverse County Road Commission in June 2020, and the highway designation was decommissioned in the process; signage was removed by August 2020 to reflect the changeover. ==Route description== M-137 began at the southern end of Interlochen State Park at an intersection with Vagabond Lane. Farther south, the roadway continues toward Green Lake Airport as County Road 137 (CR 137), also known as Karlin Road. The state highway was a two-lane road that meandered north, passing the entrance to the state park and near the Interlochen Center for the Arts. The road continued along the isthmus between Green and Duck lakes. North of the school, the highway passed through a wooded section before entering the community of Interlochen itself near the Green Lake Township Hall. There M-137 ran almost due north before terminating at its connection with the rest of the state trunkline system at US 31 at Interlochen Corners. The roadway continues north of US 31 as South Long Lake Road after the M-137 designation ended. M-137 was maintained by MDOT like other state highways in Michigan. According to the department in 2010, 4,868 vehicles used the highway daily on average. No section of M-137 had been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. ==History== reassurance marker near Diamond Park Road and the entrance to Interlochen Center for the Arts, May 2018 A highway along the route of M-137 connecting US 31 south to the state park was added to the state highway system during the first half of 1930, initially lacking a designation label on the state maps of the time. This routing was extended by and labelled as M-137 on maps in 1931. The former route through the campus of the Interlochen Center for the Arts was abandoned as a roadway on March 26, 1956, after M-137 was realigned to pass to the east of the school and extended further south through the state park area. On April 30, 2020, the GRCTC was to vote on a resolution to accept jurisdiction over M-137 from MDOT, effective June 1, 2020; the board approved the resolution. MDOT announced on August 6, 2020, that jurisdiction had been transferred at the beginning of June and that all M-137 signage had since been removed. ==Major intersections== ==See also== * ==References== ==External links== *Former M-137 at Michigan Highways 137 Category:Transportation in Grand Traverse County, Michigan \", 'title': 'M-137 (Michigan highway)', '_id': '7751000'}, {'text': 'In sociology, dynamic density refers to the combination of two things: population density and the amount of social interaction within that population. Émile Durkheim used the term to explain why societies transition from simple to more complex forms, specifically in terms of the division of labor within that society. He suggested that it required both an increase in population and an increase in the frequency of social interaction to form more specialised occupations, which then leads to a new type of society. People in this new type of society are less independent and more reliant on each other and therefore develop what he called organic solidarity, where people no longer are bound by the same morality and sense of purpose. Critics suggest that it is not a testable hypothesis, and nor does it follow logically that dynamic density would cause this new type of solidarity, supposing it actually existed. ==Context== Dynamic density is a key component in Emile Durkheim’s theory of modernization. In his book The Division of Labor in Society ([1893] 1949), Durkheim suggests that over time, societies go through a transition from being more primitive, i.e. mechanical, to being more modern, or organic; the difference lying in the source of their solidarity, or what holds them together. (Ritzer, 2007) According to Durkheim, the cause of this transition is an increase in dynamic density, an idea he drew from earlier sociologists. \"Already Adam Smith had pointed to sufficient demand as a necessary condition for specialization, and Durkheim himself refers to Comte for the idea that density of interaction is the decisive factor [for transition to occur].\" (Rueschemeyer, 1982:580) Durkheim also borrows from Darwinian theory, and specifically from Darwin\\'s The Origin of Species, for his explanation.(Rueschemeyer, 1982) In the animal kingdom, a single species of animal, like sheep, cannot survive in very high volumes on a given stretch of land because each animal makes exactly the same demands on that land. (Gibbs, 2003) They need to exist in symbiosis with other species, like the bees that fertilize the plants they consume, in order to thrive in greater numbers. (Gibbs, 2003) The same holds true within a human population. Had primitive societies increased in population density for many generations without an eventual specialization of tasks, competition for resources among the increasing number of people would have become so fierce that humans would have started dying off. (Merton, 1994) However, a growing population alone is not sufficient to spark a change in the division of labor, because individuals and small groups of people can live in relative isolation from one another and still perform most of the tasks necessary for survival themselves, no matter how big the overall population gets. (Ritzer, 2007) A growing population must also increase the frequency with which people interact within and between social groups; this increase in dynamic density is likely to spark a division of labor and the transformation of social solidarity. There are two types of social solidarity. The first is mechanical solidarity, where people are held together because they all serve the same purpose, or do the same things (as in a hunter-gatherer society), and their collective consciousness is therefore very strong. The people are all self-reliant, but they share the same experiences, understandings, and core beliefs, and can relate in that way. The second type of solidarity, organic solidarity, is the result of a substantial division of labor that has occurred due to much growth of dynamic density. People in organic solidarity have more specialized skills, so individuals are no longer self-sustaining. An example of this is that a philosopher has neither the time nor the ability to grow his own food, and so he is dependent upon a farmer and various other individuals so he can eat. In this situation, solidarity in society comes from the fact that people need the contribution of an increasing number of other people in order to function, and even to survive. (Ritzer, 2007) The transition from one type of solidarity to another is readily apparent in history when looking at societal changes from repressive law systems to restitutive law systems. A repressive law system is one in which any law breaker is severely punished for their crimes. This type of law exists in mechanical solidarity because the laws are based on the very powerful collective conscience, or set of social norms, that the people in a mechanical society all strongly believe in. Any violation of these beliefs is seen as an extreme offense against society as a whole. In contrast, a restitutive law system is characteristic of organic solidarity. Restitutive laws require an offender to pay for the harm he did to whoever was affected by his crimes, or he is just asked to comply with the law. With the growth of dynamic density and resulting division of labor in society, collective consciousness is weakened severely and people no longer have a unified sense of morality. (Muller, 1994) Everyone is no longer affected by or connected to every deviant action that takes place in society in organic solidarity, so the call for severity no longer exists. ==Critiques== There are some who disagree with Durkheim’s theory that dynamic density is the cause of social transition. Robert K. Merton argues that Durkheim has no empirical evidence supporting a link between dynamic density and a change from mechanical to organic solidarity. He says that Durkheim seeks to ignore the role that social driven ends themselves play into how society interacts. (Merton, 1994) Jack Gibbs also says that Durkheim’s theory of dynamic density leading to the division of labor is not scientifically testable for or evident of causality, arguing that there is no feasible way to measure the frequency of interactions between people, and thus no way to track progress or growth of said frequency; without these measurements, it is impossible to prove any correlation to division of labor. (Gibbs, 2003) Dietrich Rueschemeyer argues from an economics perspective that competition in production, which is the basis for a free market system, does not have the same consequences as Darwinian competition. (Rueschemeyer, 1982) To him, it follows logically that increased demand due to increased population density, for a product such as corn in an agrarian society, would improve rather than diminish the producers\\' chances of survival. (Rueschemeyer, 1982) Hence, it does not follow logically that dynamic density would cause the transition from mechanical to organic solidarity. ==See also== * Interaction frequency ==References== * Ritzer, George (2007)\"Contemporary Sociological Theory and Its Classical Roots; The Basics\" McGraw Hill * Merton, Robert K.

Society for American Baseball Research, 55th Fighter Group Association The Canadian doctor and prisoner Doug Errey produced the prosthesis for Bert. Shepard had been gunned down east of Hamburg on his 34th mission as a P-38 fighter pilot; his life was saved by the doctor Lieutenant Ladislaus Loidl of the German Army. On February 21, 1945, Shepard was back in the United States and hoping to resume his pitching career. Prior to the war, he had pitched for minor leagues all across the country, including the Anaheim Aces in 1941. During spring training in 1945, he impressed Senators owner Clark Griffith enough to be hired as a pitching coach. He pitched exhibition games and batting practice as well as one regulation game, making him the first man with an artificial leg to pitch in a major league baseball game. On August 4, 1945 Shepard got the call to enter in the fourth inning of a home game in which the Senators were well behind the Boston Red Sox. It was game two of Washington\\'s fourth consecutive doubleheader, with a fifth scheduled the next day as well. Shepard made headlines not only for being in the game itself, but also for his 5⅓ innings of impressive relief, allowing only three hits and one run. He struck out the first batter he faced. The final score was Red Sox 15, Senators 4.Weintraub, Robert (2013) The Victory Season: The End of World War II and the Birth of Baseball\\'s Golden Age. New York: Little Brown and Company, pages 137-138 The game of August 4, 1945 was notable for two other events as well. Shepard came in to relieve teammate Joe Cleary, whose surrender of seven runs on five hits and three walks in one-third of an inning in his only big-league appearance earned him the highest lifetime ERA — 189.00 — of any pitcher in Major League Baseball history to have recorded at least one out. Also, outfielder Tom McBride tied a major league record with 6 runs batted in in the fourth inning, which was pitched by Cleary. In between games of a doubleheader on August 31, Shepard received the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal for his service in World War II. He later went on to be a player/manager in the minor leagues until 1954. He was a key participant in the National Amps baseball teams of former servicemen with amputations secondary to war injuries. After retiring from baseball, Shepard worked for IBM and Hughes Aircraft as a safety engineer. Shepard won the U.S. amputee golf championship in 1968 and 1971. Shepard died at age 87 in Highland, California. He was buried at Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California.Baseball\\'s Greatest Sacrifice ==References== ==Further reading== *Dennis Snelling: A Glimpse of Fame, McFarland & Company, Jefferson N.C., 1993, pp. 115–134 *Richard Tellis: Once Around The Bases, Triumph Books, Chicago, 1998, pp. 107–120. ==External links== *Baseball in Wartime *BaseballLibrary – biography & photograph *BaseballLibrary – Once Around the Bases *Baseball Guru – Bert Shepard and the Missing Foot *New York Times obituary, June 19, 2008 Category:1920 births Category:2008 deaths Category:American amputees Category:American disabled sportspeople Category:Amputee sportspeople Category:Anaheim Aces players Category:Baseball players from Indiana Category:Bisbee Bees players Category:Burials at Riverside National Cemetery Category:Chattanooga Lookouts players Category:Decatur Commodores players Category:Duluth Dukes players Category:Hot Springs Bathers players Category:Jeanerette Blues players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Military personnel from Indiana Category:Modesto Reds players Category:Mount Airy Graniteers players Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Category:St. Augustine Saints players Category:Shot-down aviators Category:United States Army Air Forces officers Category:United States Army Air Forces pilots of World War II Category:Tampa Smokers players Category:Washington Senators (1901–1960) coaches Category:Washington Senators (1901–1960) players Category:Williston Oilers players Category:Wisconsin Rapids White Sox players Category:World War II prisoners of war held by Germany Category:Disabled baseball players ', 'title': 'Bert Shepard', '_id': '7751042'}, {'text': \"Marc Fein (born Marc Alan Fein October 21, 1967 in Miami, Florida) is a sports journalist, sports news anchor, and television sports studio host, formerly one of the main studio hosts for the NBA TV show, NBA Gametime Live.

The stadium would be given the name of Arteveldestadion (after Jacob van Artevelde) and should help in the further growth of the team. Due to multiple problems, including issued building permits and financial difficulties, it would take until 18 September 2008 before the official foundation stone could be laid by meanwhile mayor Daniël Termont and president of KAA Gent Ivan De Witte. In 2009 new problems concerning the financing of the stadium became public. In June 2010, the city of Ghent announced that it had come to a definitive agreement with real estate developer Ghelamco about the construction and exploitation of the stadium. After approval of the adapted lease agreement in the city council, which was realized during the meeting of October 2010, the construction works were started immediately. They were scheduled to be finished before the start of the 2012–13 Belgian Pro League, but were delayed one more year. On 31 May 2013, a few months before the official opening, it was officially announced that the stadium would be named Ghelamco Arena, after the constructor. The stadium was officially inaugurated on 17 July 2013 with and exhibition game (in which KAA Gent defeated VfB Stuttgart 2-0) and a performance by 2manydjs. ==Details== ===Mobility=== The stadium counts with 1,200 parking spots, mainly for employees, security and safety services, members of the press, VIPs and disabled people. In addition, there are approximately 1,000 carpool spots for supporters within a radius of 1.2 kilometers around the stadium. Alternative ways of reaching the stadium can be found in public transport. On match days, shuttle buses drive between the arena and the Woodrow Wilson Square in the city centre. Bus lines 65 and 67 take people from the Gent-Sint-Pieters railway station to the stadium. ===Entertainment=== Throughout the year, businesses can rent parts of the stadium to host a variety of events. During the 2014 FIFA World Cup, all games of the Belgium national football team were shown on big screens, accompanied by performances of Belgian artists Regi Penxten, Clouseau, Natalia and Milk Inc.. ===Offices, retail and catering=== Ghelamco Arena is the home base of real estate developer Ghelamco and houses an Albert Heijn store, an employment agency and a gym.

Grant as the original anchor tenants. In the mid-1970s, JCPenney replaced Grant's as the mall's third anchor. A major overhaul in the late-1980s transformed the mall into an enclosed shopping center with Gottschalks added as a fourth anchor tenant. JCPenney closed on January 25, 1997, and was occupied for several years by a furniture retailer until the building was gutted in 2003 and replaced by the larger two-story Macy's anchor in 2004. Further expansion brought in Marshalls as a fifth anchor in March 2008. In August 2008, Mervyns announced it would close several underperforming stores, including the Somersville Towne Center location, which closed in December of that year. Gottschalks closed due to bankruptcy in 2009, leaving two anchors vacant at the mall. In late 2012, it was announced that a trampoline park was slated to take a portion of the former Gottschalks. In December 2016, half of the former Gottschalks building became a 24 Hour Fitness Super Sport club; the other half of the building remains vacant.

On the death Ferdinand in 1578, Diego became heir-apparent to the throne. Diego also had another elder brother, Carlos Lorenzo, who died in infancy. His mother had just learned of the death of Carlos Lorenzo, and she was said to have suffered such a shock from word of his death that it caused her to go into premature labour, giving birth to Diego. The birth of Ferdinand Prince of Asturias Diego's elder brother He was formally invested as Prince of Asturias on 1 March 1580 by the Courts in Madrid.Friedrich Christoph Schlosser, Georg Ludwig Kriegk: World History for the German people, Vol. 13, Varrentrapp, 1852, p. 202. The poet Cristóbal de Virués dedicated a sonnet to the new Prince, where he proposed that Diego follow the steps of his father.Freiherr von Münch: Book for Latin and English literature, Ferd. Dümmler, 1860, p.159. In 1580, his father became King of Portugal as well, making Diego heir-apparent of that realm also. His mother, Anna, died during a trip to their new kingdom. Diego and his siblings remained in Madrid under the care of half-sisters, Isabella Clara Eugenia and Catherine Michelle. The letters of Philip II make clear that he was extremely proud of Diego: he wrote that his son had already learned the alphabet and dancing by the age of five. In a letter dated 1582 the king wrote to the Indian Viceroy Francisco de Mascarenhas commanding that he bring an elephant to the Prince of Asturias as a gift. Philip II taught his son the Portuguese language so that one day Diego could speak as king with his Portuguese subjects. In addition, Philip II planned to betroth Diego to one of the daughters of John, Duke of Braganza and Catherine of Portugal. == Death == Diego never became king. In late 1582 he contracted smallpox and died at the age of 7. At his death, Philip II was inconsolable, for the only heir to the throne remaining was the small and sickly Infante Philip, assuming the position of Prince of Asturias. The king gave orders that continuous prayers be said at the Church of Our Blessed Lady in Zaragoza for the health of the royal children remaining. Diego's younger brother became King Philip III upon his father's death in 1598.

It was designed by James Birrell and built from 1964 to 1974. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 December 2004. == History == The Union College building at the University of Queensland campus was built in five major stages between 1964 and 1972 to the design of James Birrell, Staff Architect for the University between 1961 and 1966. Proposals for a Queensland university were first made in the 1870s, but the idea did not have strong public or government support in a new colony where tertiary education was not a funding priority. An Act of State Parliament eventually established the new University of Queensland on December 10, 1909. Sir William MacGregor, the incoming Governor of Queensland, was appointed as the first Chancellor. Before his arrival, it had been decided to purchase and renovate \"Fernberg\", a house at Bardon, as the new Government House and to use the vacated government residence and part of its grounds at Gardens Point for the University. This was a controversial decision and many thought that the building and domain were unsuitable and too small for the purpose. There was little room for expansion and there were conflicts with the neighbouring Brisbane Central Technical College. In 1910 the first teaching faculties were created and in early 1911 the first students enrolled, although relocation was already being discussed. Victoria Park had been chosen in 1906 as a campus site, though the high cost of preparing the steeply sloping land for building presented problems and Yeronga Park and St Lucia were also considered as options. In 1926 the difficulty of obtaining a suitable permanent site was solved when Dr James Mayne and Miss Mary Mayne made £50,000 available to the Brisbane City Council to resume land at St Lucia and present it to the University. In 1930 the University Senate handed over Victoria Park, less eleven acres reserved for a medical school, to the Brisbane City Council in exchange for the St Lucia site. During the years of the Depression that followed, government funding and staff numbers were reduced, although student enrolments trebled between 1923 and 1933. There was no prospect of building on the new site until 1935 when the Premier, William Forgan Smith, announced that the Queensland Government would undertake construction. The University Senate committee produced a preliminary design and the Sydney firm of Hennessy, Hennessy & Co was appointed as architects for the project. They produced the Great Court plan with its sandstone, classically inspired buildings that remains central to the University and which influenced later building. The foundation stone was laid in 1937 but the Second World War disrupted work and the main building was used as the headquarters of General Sir Thomas Blamey, head of the Australian Defence forces. Work had re-commenced by 1948 and the Forgan Smith Building was officially opened in May 1949 followed by other major buildings of the Great Court in the 1950s and 60s. Residential Colleges to accommodate the students had been established for some time on the edges of the inner city area but it was intended that they should relocate when permanent sites were available on the new campus. Sites had been allocated for Emmanuel, St John\\'s, King\\'s, St Leo\\'s, Duchesne and Women\\'s Colleges, although the war had halted construction plans, as it had the development of the University buildings. Religious institutions ran all but Women\\'s College and all accommodated only a single gender. In 1943 the University of Queensland Students\\' Union planned a non- denominational Union College as an alternative to traditional religious colleges. It was expected that after the war student numbers would increase greatly and that accommodation would be in short supply. A Student Housing Committee was formed. It was intended that the new college should be owned by the Union, run by a Warden elected by the students and approved by the university Senate, and governed by a representative body of students. However, land had only been allocated at St Lucia for the six colleges existing when plans were drawn up in the 1930s. High building costs also delayed the construction of a new building and the Union opened a student hostel in rented premises in Wickham Terrace in 1947. By 1950 the hostel had gained College status and in 1952, the Union requested that land be allocated for the college on the St Lucia campus. Land opposite the St John\\'s College site and bordered by the no 1 oval and a grove of native trees was reserved for Union College in December 1952. Building schemes were considered in 1953, but the cost was too great and the Union purchased two large houses in Wickham Terrace in April 1956, after the premises they had formerly rented was sold. In January 1958, a sub committee was set up to consider building schemes, though these could not be implemented until the 1963-66 triennium. The buildings at Wickham Terrace had proved to be a good investment and the loan was paid out by 1960. It was decided to survey the St Lucia site, though the University\\'s Staff Architect, James Birrell, questioned its suitability. He suggested that \"if the Union College were built along the west frontage of the Tree Reserve in buildings artfully arranged to avoid destruction of trees, it would be on elevated ground, not overlooked by surrounding country, associated only with residential development and on good foundation.\" This new site was approved and transferred to the college in December and Birrell began preparation of plans for the college. James Peter Birrell was born in Melbourne and studied architecture at Melbourne Technical College. Following World War Two he worked as a draughtsman for the State, then the Commonwealth Works Departments. As a cadet architect with the Commonwealth Department of Works he was accepted as a fourth year student at the University of Melbourne. After graduating in 1951 he graduated and worked briefly as Resident Architect at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. In 1952 he co-founded Architecture and Arts with Peter Burns, Helen O\\'Donnell and Norman Lehey. Transferred to Canberra, he worked on the design of schools, telephone exchanges, group housing, and alterations to the Canberra Repertory Theatre. Moving back to Melbourne in 1953, he worked on post office buildings. Birrell exhibited with the Contemporary Art Society and helped to organise a tour for them before being transferred to Darwin to take charge of the Commonwealth Department drawing office. Here he designed schools, hospital extensions, shopping centres and various ancillary structures. In 1955 he resigned from the Commonwealth Works Department and was appointed Architect in Charge of the drawing office of the Brisbane City Council\\'s Architectural Branch. While with the Council, he designed a large number of public buildings, many of which were illustrated in national design journals, and included such innovative buildings as the former Toowong Municipal Library Building, the Centenary Pool Complex and the Wickham Terrace Carpark. Birrell was Architect to the University of Queensland from 1961–66, overseeing the university\\'s second major phase of construction development. Beginning part-time lecturing at the University\\'s Department of Architecture and at Queensland Institute of Technology, he also worked on the Master Plan for the expansion of the University. His most notable buildings designed in this period include Union College, the JD Story Administration Building, Staff House and the Agriculture and Entomology Building (now the Hartley Teakle Building). As part of his work for the University, he designed the James Cook University in Townsville in 1963, and continued to design buildings for the St Lucia campus. In 1965 Birrell was appointed President of the Australian Planning Institute. In 1966 he designed the Union Theatre and Hartley Teakle Building before moving into private practice. By July 1963, Birrell had developed a plan for Union College that he believed would provide a residential collegiate atmosphere without undue institutional appearance. This has been achieved by meandering the dormitory block in a more or less rambling fashion so that it encloses in effect two cloistered courtyards, one of which overlooks no 2 oval across the top of the communal facilities building and the other, the residential section of Upland Road. Incidentally, this meandering avoids the removal of any substantial trees. The facilities block has been arranged along even contours one floor lower than the dormitory building so that at no point are the bedroom outlooks detrimentally affected. Service entrance is at the north so that service facilities are grouped against the future substation area that adjoins the sites, hence buffering incompatible areas from the College. The facilities block requires the removal of two trees only. This plan represented the cutting edge of international ideas on architecture in respect of its form and the mode of its construction and generated a considerable amount of interest in the building and design industries. It achieved a combination of good quality design and economy while responding imaginatively to its site. In an era when buildings in Queensland were generally constructed on a cleared and levelled site, not only the placement, but also the design of the college buildings was influenced by the existing topography and vegetation, which became part of the design. Union College would affect the funding of college buildings throughout Australia. The tender of T J Watkins was accepted in June 1964 and the first stage was still being completed when Education Minister, Jack Pizzey, officially opened it in July 1965. The first stage comprised part of the Common Facilities wing residential blocks and staff quarters at a cost of £240,000 ($480,000). The new college was adjudged one of the ten best buildings in Australia for 1965 by the Australian Journal of Architecture and Arts. Union College marked a departure from the design of other residential colleges on campus. Innovative features ranged from the large one piece pivoting windows to the flat roof intended to be used for living and recreational space. Forms were simple and robust and the stone, timber, off form concrete and metals chosen were intended to weather to soft tones of grey with contrasts in texture. The college was not only innovative in its form and use of materials and in its response to the site, but also in concept. Previous designs for student accommodation in Queensland were more conservative and had followed traditional institutional models. Union College had courtyards, recreational and tutorial facilities and student units, providing a modern lifestyle for adult students. As an extension of this approach, in 1968 Union College became the first coeducational residential college in Queensland (in 1967 University Hall at the Townsville University College opened for student accommodation as a coeducational residential college Extensions were carried out during the 1963-66 triennium including extending the facilities wing, landscaping and constructing the warden\\'s residence on the ground floor of block F. The tender of C P Hornick and Sons was accepted in May 1966 for an overall cost of $77,463. The next stage comprised construction of Block C (floors GHJ and KLM). The tender of Harris James was accepted in July 1967 and the work was completed in June 1968 at a cost of $412,815. Half of the rooms in this residential block were made available to women students, though they were at first accommodated on different floors to the men. In June 1968 the Brisbane City Council purchased the two old college buildings in Wickham Terrace at a cost of $265,000. Planning for the 4th stage of construction began in 1969. This was to complete the residential wings and build units for married tutors and tutorial rooms. Federal funding of $150,000 was granted for this stage (PQR floors) and the tender of C P Hornick was accepted in December 1969. The completed cost was $397,344. Plans were then begun for the completion of the college (XYZ floors). Harris James tender was accepted in January 1973 and work was finalized in 1974. The college as a whole was estimated to have cost $1,500,000 to build. In the late 1990s a detached brick function room with a tiled, hipped roof was constructed to the rear of the kitchen. It was also designed by Birrell, but does not match the earlier buildings in form or materials. Some changes have taken place, though the buildings are substantially intact and retain their character. The off-form concrete has been painted with sealant. Trios of hopper windows have replaced the majority of the large pivoted windowpanes that formed a distinctive feature of the design. An unsympathetic security fence has been added at the south. The landmark trees, which were an important part of the original design concept, remain though secondary planting of has been added. == Description == Western Wing, 2014 The University of Queensland is located on a large allotment on a bend of the Brisbane River at St Lucia. The Great Court is sited to dominate the rise of the land and have a commanding view of the surrounding campus buildings, the playing fields and the river beyond. The residential colleges are grouped to the south along the river with Union College set slightly further back. Union College comprises several buildings. The two main buildings are linear in form and have an extruded appearance. The facilities block is a single-storey building facing north-east, which flows through underneath the lower storey of the residential block. The structure has a steel sheeted roof supported by an off-form concrete portal frame infilled with Mt Coot-tha bluestone. This type of structure creates a large open-plan internal space. The floors are parquetry, the ceilings are lined with strawboard and the joinery is blackbean. There is a distinctive brick fireplace with four arched openings over a central hearth. There are courtyards formed between the angles of the buildings. Raised areas set with trees and surrounded by bluestone retaining walls preserve original hillocks on the site. The existing major trees have been supplemented by plantings of other trees, shrubs and flowering plants The residential block is a three- storey building supported on off-form concrete pilotis. Sections of it are infilled below as the ground level drops away, but the three storey residential section is constant. The plan form of the building follows different angles, facing variously north-east, east, and north, creating courtyards that contain large mature trees and gardens. The pilotis support dark manganese brick internal walls. Open stairwells with off-form concrete external balustrades are located at regular intervals along the building. The external areas of off-form concrete have been painted. Windows are metal framed, with the original windows composed of a large panel spanning the window space at the top with two smaller windows below. All are pivoted horizontally and double-glazed with Venetian blinds enclosed. Most of the upper panels of the original windows have been replaced with triple hopper windows. The roof is reinforced concrete, and ceilings are sprayed vermiculite. The former staff house lies between the accommodation and facilities blocks and echoes the form and materials of the accommodation blocks. It is .is a two-storey building constructed of brick and off form concrete with steel framed windows. == Heritage listing == Union College was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 December 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland\\'s history. Union College marks an important stage in the modern development of the University of Queensland. An innovative residential college designed in 1963, it was modern and functional in concept and construction and responds to the vegetation and topography of its site. It marked a departure from college design on this campus and reflected international ideas on architecture. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Union College was highly praised at the time of its building as visually pleasing, well conceived and innovative structure. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. Union College was highly praised at the time of its building as visually pleasing, well conceived and innovative structure. The design was innovative in its interaction with the site, in its form and use of materials and represented a high degree of creative achievement, recognised by a High Commendation award by Arts and Architecture journal as one of the best ten new buildings in Australia at the time. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Union College has social significance as an important component of university life to the many people who have resided there as students or as teachers and administrators. It also represented a departure from tradition in the provision of a modern lifestyle for students and as the first residential college in Queensland to offer accommodation to both men and women. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland\\'s history. Union College is important as a major work of James Birrell, an architect of national stature and repute, and is evidence of his thought and practice. Birrell was Staff Architect for the University of Queensland when he selected the site and designed Union College and was involved with the master planning of the campus. He had a design philosophy that integrated structures and landscape as evidenced by this building. The work of James Birrell, particularly for the Brisbane City Council and the University of Queensland is widely held to be influential and innovative. == References == === Attribution === == External links == Category:Queensland Heritage Register Category:St Lucia, Queensland Category:Residential colleges of the University of Queensland Category:Articles incorporating text from the Queensland Heritage Register Category:1965 establishments in Australia Category:Buildings and structures in Brisbane Category:James Birrell buildings ', 'title': 'Union College, University of Queensland', '_id': '7751199'}, {'text': \"Exploiting Dysfunction is Cephalic Carnage's second full-length album.

The archipelago is 120 km long and 70 km broad, made up of 11 uninhabited islets and many reefs. The land area of the islands is less than 10 km². During periods of lowered sea level during the Pleistocene ice ages an island of considerable size (Greater Chesterfield Island) occupied the location of the archipelago. Bellona Reef, 164 km south-southeast of Chesterfield, is geologically separated from the Chesterfield archipelago but commonly included. ==Etymology== The reef complex is named after the whaling ship , commanded by Matthew Bowes Alt, which sailed through the Coral Sea in the 1790s. == Location == The Chesterfield Islands, sometimes referred to as the Chesterfield Reefs or Chesterfield Group, are the most important of a number of uninhabited coral sand cays. Some are awash and liable to shift with the wind while others are stabilized by the growth of grass, creepers and low trees. The reefs extend from 19˚ to 22˚S between 158–160˚E in the southern Coral Sea halfway between Australia and New Caledonia. The Chesterfield Reefs are now part of the territory of New Caledonia while the islands farther west are part of the Australian Coral Sea Islands Territory. Chesterfield lagoon, located between 19˚00\\' and 20˚30\\' S and 158˚10\\' and 159˚E covers an area of approximately 3500 km2. A barrier reef surrounds the lagoon, interrupted by wide passes except on its eastern side where it is open for over . The major part of the lagoon is exposed to trade winds and to the southeastern oceanic swell. The lagoon is relatively deep with a mean depth of 51 m. The depth increases from south to north. Chesterfield Reefs complex consists of the Bellona Reef complex to the south (South, Middle and Northwest Bellona Reef) and the Bampton Reef complex. === Bellona Reefs === Bellona Reefs South Bellona Reefs Captain Matthew Boyd of Bellona named the reefs for his ship. He had delivered convicts to New South Wales in 1793 and was on his way to China to pick up a cargo at Canton to take back to Britain for the British East India Company when he passed the reefs in February–March 1793. *West Point , *Olry Reef , on the south an unvegetated sand cay Caye Est Bellona *Middle Bellona Reefs , *Observatory Cay , *Booby Reef , *Northwest Bellona Reef , *Noel Bank , *South Bellona Reef or West Point , Approximately 3 m tall sand islet, reported to be non-existent by 1988 (Sailing Directions) Lieutenant John Lamb, R.N., Commander of the ship Baring, spent three days in the neighborhood of Booby and Bellona Shoals and reefs. Lamb took soundings between nineteen and forty-five fathoms (114–270 ft), and frequently passed shoals, upon which the sea was breaking. Lamb defined the limits of the rocky ground as the parallels of 20°40′ and 21°50′ and the meridians of 158°15′ and 159°30′. He also saw a sandy islet, surrounded by a chain of rocks, at 21°24½′ south and 158°30′ east. The ship Minerva measured the water\\'s depth as eight fathoms (48 ft), with the appearance of shallower water to the southwest; this last danger is in a line between the two shoals at about longitude 159°20′ east, as described by James Horsburgh. Observatory Cay (Caye de l\\'Observatoire) , 800 m long and 2 m high, lies on the Middle Bellona Reefs at the southern end of the Chesterfield Reefs and 180 nm east of Kenn Reef. === Minerva Shoal === :Not to be confused with Minerva Reefs, south of Fiji and Tonga. *Minerva Shoal, === Chesterfield Reefs === *South Elbow or Loop Islet, *Anchorage Islets , *Passage Islet (Bennett Islet), *Long Island , The Chesterfield Reefs is a loose collection of elongated reefs that enclose a deep, semi-sheltered, lagoon. The reefs on the west and northwest are known as the Chesterfield Reefs; those on the east and north being the Bampton Reefs. The Chesterfield Reefs form a structure measuring 120 km in length (northeast to southwest) and 70 km across (east to west). There are numerous cays occurring amongst the reefs of both the Chesterfield and Bampton Reefs. These include: Loop Islet, Renard Cay, Skeleton Cay, Bennett Island, Passage Islet, Long Island, the Avon Isles, the Anchorage Islets and Bampton Island. Long Island , 10 nm NW of Loop Islet, is the largest of the Chesterfield Islands, and is 1400 to 1800 m long but no more than 100 m across and 9 m high. In May 1859 Henry Mangles Denham found Long Island was “a heap of \\'foraminifera\\' densely covered with stunted bush‑trees with leaves as large as cabbage plants, spreading 12 feet (3.7 m) and reaching as high, upon trunks 9 inches (23 cm) diameter... The trees around the margin of this island were leafless, as if from the sea‑fowl.\" Although wooded in the 1850s, it was stripped during guano extraction in the 1870s and was said to be covered in grass with only two coconut trees and some ruins at the south end early in the 20th century. The vegetation was growing again by 1957 when the remaining ruins were confused with those of a temporary automatic meteorological station established in the same area by the Americans between 1944 and 1948. Terry Walker reported that by 1990 there was a ring of low Tournefortia trees growing around the margin, herbs, grass and shrubs in the interior, and still a few exotic species including coconuts. South of Long Island and Loop Islet there are three small low islets (Martin, Veys and Passage islets)up to 400 m across followed, after a narrow channel, by Passage or Bennett Island, which is 12 m high and was a whaling station in the first half of the 20th century. Several sand cays lie on the reef southeast of the islet. === Avon Isles === *Avon Isles (Northwest Point) , *Avon Isles (south) The two Avon Isles , some 188 m in diameter and 5 m high to the top of the dense vegetation, are situated 21 n.m. north of Long Island. They were seen by Mr. Sumner, Master of the ship Avon, on 18 September 1823, and are described by him as being three- quarters of a mile in circumference, twenty feet high, and the sea between them twenty fathoms deep. At four miles (7 km) northeast by north from them the water was twelve fathoms (72 feet) deep, and at the same time they saw a reef ten or fifteen miles (20–30 km) to the southeast, with deep water between it and the islets. A boat landed on the south-westernmost islet, and found it inhabited only by birds, but clothed with shrubs and wild grapes. By observation, these islands were found to lie in latitude 19 degrees 40 minutes, and longitude 158 degrees 6 minutes. The Avon Isles are described by Denham in 1859 as “densely covered with stunted trees and creeping plants and grass, and... crowded with the like species of birds.\" === Bampton Reefs === *Bampton Reefs *Bampton Island , *North Bampton Reef , *Northeast Bampton Reef , *Renard Island , *Skeleton Cay Renard Island North Bampton Reef , Approximately tall sand islet lies northeast of the Avon Isles and is long, across and also high to the top of the bushes. Southeast Bampton Reef Sand Cay elevation Loop Islet , which lies 85 nm farther north near the south end of the central islands of Chesterfield Reefs, is a small, flat, bushy islet 3 m high where a permanent automatic weather station was established by the Service Météorologique de Nouméa in October 1968. Terry Walker reported the presence of a grove of Casuarinas in 1990. Anchorage Islets are a group of islets five nautical miles (9 km) north of Loop Islet. The third from the north, about 400 m long and 12 m high, shelters the best anchorage. Passage (Bonnet) Island reaches a vegetative height of 12 m Bampton Island , lies on Bampton Reefs 20 nm NW of Renard Island. It is 180 m long, 110 m across and 5 m high. It had trees when discovered in 1793, but has seldom been visited since then except by castaways. The reefs and islands west of the Chesterfield Islands, the closest being Mellish Reef with Herald\\'s Beacon Islet at , at a distance of 180 nm northwest of Bampton Island, belong to the Coral Sea Islands Territory. == History == ===18th Century=== Booby Reef in the center of the eastern chain of reefs and islets comprising Chesterfield Reefs appears to have been discovered first by Lt. Henry Lidgbird Ball in HMS Supply on the way from Sydney to Batavia (modern day Jakarta) in 1790. The reefs to the south were found next by Mathew Boyd in the convict ship Bellona on his way from Sydney to Canton (modern day Guangzhou) in February or March 1793. The following June, William Wright Bampton became embayed for five days at the north end of Chesterfield Reefs in the Indiaman Shah Hormuzeer, together with Mathew Bowes Alt in the whaler Chesterfield. Bampton reported two islets with trees and “a number of birds of different species around the ships, several of them the same kind as at Norfolk Island”. ===19th Century=== The reefs continued to present a hazard to shipping plying between Australia and Canton or India (where cargo was collected on the way home to Europe). The southern reefs were surveyed by Captain Henry Mangles Denham in the Herald from 1858 to 1860. He made the natural history notes discussed below. The northern reefs were charted by Lieutenant G.E.Richards in HMS Renard in 1878 and the French the following year. Denham\\'s conclusions are engraved on British Admiralty Chart 349: The area is a wintering ground for numerous Humpback whales and smaller numbers of Sperm whales. During the 19th century the Chesterfield Islands were visited by increasing numbers of whalers during the off season in New Zealand. L. Thiercelin reported that in July 1863 the islets only had two or three plants, including a bush 3–4 m high, and were frequented by turtles weighing 60 to 100 kg. Many eggs were being taken regularly by several English, two French and one American whaler. On another occasion there were no less than eight American whalers. A collection of birds said to have been made by Surgeon Jourde of the French whaler Général d’Hautpoul on the Brampton Shoals in July 1861 was subsequently brought by Gerard Krefft (1862) to the Australian Museum, but clearly not all the specimens came from there. On 27 October 1862, the British Government granted an exclusive concession to exploit the guano on Lady Elliot Island, Wreck Reef, Swain Reefs, Raine Island, Bramble Cay, Brampton Shoal, and Pilgrim Island to the Anglo Australian Guano Company organized by the whaler Dr. William Crowther in Hobart, Tasmania. They were apparently most active on Bird Islet (Wreck Reef) and Lady Elliot and Raine Islands (Hutchinson, 1950), losing five ships at Bird Islet between 1861 and 1882 (Crowther 1939). It is not clear that they ever took much guano from the Chesterfield Islands unless it was obtained from Higginson, Desmazures et Cie, discussed below. When in 1877 Joshua William North also found guano on the Chesterfield Reefs, Alcide Jean Desmazures persuaded Governor Orly of New Caledonia to send the warship La Seudre to annex them. There were estimated to be about 185,000 cu m of guano on Long Island and a few hundred tons elsewhere, and 40% to 62% phosphate (Chevron, 1880), which was extracted between 1879 and 1888 by Higginson, Desmazures et Cie of Nouméa (Godard, nd), leaving Long Island stripped bare for a time (Anon., 1916). ===20th and 21st Century=== Apparently the islands were then abandoned until Commander Arzur in the French warship Dumont d’Urville surveyed the Chesterfield Reefs and erected a plaque in 1939. In September 1944, American forces installed a temporary automatic meteorological station at the south end of Long Island, which was abandoned again at the end of World War II. The first biological survey was made of Long Island by Cohic during four hours ashore on 26 September 1957. It revealed, among other things, a variety of avian parasites including a widespread Ornithodoros tick belonging to a genus carrying arboviruses capable of causing illness in humans. This island and the Anchorage Islets were also visited briefly during a survey of New Caledonian coral reefs in 1960 and 1962. An aerial magnetic survey was made of the Chesterfield area in 1966, and a seismic survey in 1972, which apparently have not been followed up yet. In November 1968 another automatic meteorological station was installed on Loop Islet where 10 plants were collected by A.E. Ferré. Since then the Centre de Nouméa of the Office de la Recherche Scientifique et Technique Outre Mer has arranged for periodic surveys and others when this installation is serviced. From 1982-1992 Terry Walker carried out methodical surveys of the Coral Sea islets with the intention of producing a seabird atlas. He visited the central islands of the Chesterfield Reefs in December 1990. An amateur radio DX-pedition (TX3X) was conducted on one of the islands in October 2015. == Known Shipwrecks on the Reef == Unless otherwise noted, information in this section is from Coral Sea and Northern Great Barrier Reef Shipwrecks. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Notes |- | Borough Belle || Wooden Brigantine || 103.8 || 24.1 || 11.8 || 1875 || 30 January 1894 || 210 tons. Built in Sydney. The brigantine had been badly damaged by gales and she was run ashore onto Bellona Reefs to save life on a voyage from Solomon Islands to Sydney. The crew remained at the wreck until 3 February, then set out for Australia. At an inquiry the master and part owner John Williams was commended for his able seamanship. |- | || Whaler || || || || 1791 || || Gave its name to Chesterfield Reef. |- | Clarence || Whaling brig || 68 || 19.2 || 11 || 1841 || 9 June 1844 || 120 tons. Built at Clarence River, New South Wales. Registered at Sydney 46/1841. Captain McCardell. Lost on the Chesterfield Bank, near the Bampton Shoals. After a voyage of in four boats the crew reached safety although some of the crew were speared when they landed on the Queensland coast in search of water. The whaler Woodlark assisted in the rescue of one of the boats. The schooner Elizabeth was lost attempting to salvage the Clarence the following year. |- | Eillan Donan || Brigantine || || || || 1863 || Late December 1893 || 270 tons. Registered in Auckland. Believed lost on Chesterfield Reefs. The vessel was likely named for the home of the clan McRae, Eilean Donan Castle. This is one of the most photographed castles in Scotland. |- | Elizabeth || Schooner || || || || || 1844 || Lost on Chesterfield Bank, near the Bampton Shoals. While attempting to salvage the wreck of the Clarence the Elizabeth was driven out to sea while most of her crew were working on the wreck. She was never seen again. The crew reached Moreton Bay, Queensland by longboat on 26 March 1845. |- | Euromedha || Barque || || || || 1868 || 2 October 1869 || 345 tons. Built in Sunderland, England. Struck the eastern edge of Bampton Reef and sank rapidly. The crew was saved. |- | Hamlet\\'s Ghost || Boat || || || || || || Small vessel built from the salvaged timbers from the whaling schooner Prince of Denmark, wrecked on Chesterfield reef in 1863. [Holthouse] |- | Isabella || Barque || 159 || 32.2 || 21 || 1860 || 4 July 1875 || 734 tons. Built in Sunderland. Master Captain Smith. Wrecked on Chesterfield Reef while en route from Newcastle NSW (departed 26 June) to Hong Kong. Crew of 16 with an additional 17 Chinese passengers on board as well as 800 tons of coal. One boat containing the captain and nine men set out for the mainland, six landed on an island and decided to await rescue while the seventeen Chinese passengers remained at the wreck. The captain\\'s boat was rescued by the Currambene and taken to Bowen, Queensland but the other survivors were apparently forgotten. On 2 January 1876, the Laura Lind found only three of the six remaining white men alive when the schooner called at the island. Of the Chinese, ten were drowned, one died of starvation and one committed suicide because he could not obtain any opium. The Marine Board of Queensland found a fault in the chronometers had caused an error of more than in the position of the ship and the master was exonerated. |- | Jessie || Wooden Barkentine || 124 || 25.1 || 12.8 || || 18 February 1893 || 247 tons. During a cyclone she was forced ashore at Long Island while loading guano for Launceston, Tasmania. Dangerous conditions forced her crew to seek shelter on the island, and when the weather cleared all that remained of their vessel were a few pieces of wreckage. The master and crew reached Nouméa in one of the boats. |- | Madeira Packet || Schooner || || || || || December 1831 || 108 tons. Captain Arnold. Left Sydney for New Zealand on a whaling cruise, on 4 September 1831; wrecked on Bampton Reefs. The crew took to three boats; two made it safely to Moreton Bay, the third disappeared. It appears that Captain Arnold had died on board before her loss. |- | Peruvian || Barque || || || || || February or March 1846 || Lost at Minerva or Bellona Reefs. Carrying a load of timber, battered by heavy weather and wrecked on the reefs. |- | Prince of Denmark || Whaling Schooner || || || || 1789 || 19 March 1863 || 69 tons. Captain J.B. Bennett. Wrecked during a gale while approaching Chesterfield Reef. The crew used the remains of the whaler to build a new boat (which they called Hamlet\\'s Ghost), then set sail for Brisbane, leaving eleven native members of the crew on the reef with provisions for about eighteen months. They made Moreton bay on 17 June. The boat was later converted to a pleasure yacht. There is no record of what happened to the eleven natives. [Holthouse] |- | Sarah S. Ridgeway || Wooden Barque || || || || || || 831 tons. American Registered at Wilmington, Delaware on 29 January 1895. The ship was lost on Bellona Reef while on her way from Newcastle to Singapore with coal. There was no loss of life and the crew landed at Burnett Heads, Queensland. |- | Siskin || Wooden Ketch || 61.3 || 17.6 || 5.5 || 1884 || Early November 1896 || 41 tons.

Lost on Chesterfield Reefs. |- | Waireta || Schooner || || || || 1884 || || 99 tons. Built in 1884 and registered at Auckland, New Zealand, on 21 May 1892. While landing machinery at Long Island she parted her cables in heavy weather and went ashore. A court of inquiry decided that she would not have been lost if she had been better found in ground tackle. |- | Fotini Carras || Screw Steamer || 375.6 || 51.7 || 26.5 || 26 September 1918 || 07 June 1939 || 4453 Gross tons.

The school is located on Leslie Street, just north of Elgin Mills Road. The school is managed by the York Region District School Board. The school is a large, three-story building attached to the Richmond Green Public Library, which also serves as a school library. It is named after the adjacent Richmond Green park. ==History== Despite officially opening as a high school in 2005, the building was built a year earlier and functioned as a temporary elementary school due to the nearby Lincoln Alexander Public School experiencing major construction setbacks. During the 2005/2006 school year, another York Region District School Board elementary school occupied the third floor due to an extensive asbestos cleanup occurring in their building. At this time, secondary school classes were restricted to the first and second floors. ==Inauguration== Richmond Green had an enrollment of approximately 331 Grade 9 and 10 students and over 30 staff in its inaugural school year. Most of the Grade 10 students came from nearby Bayview Secondary School and Richmond Hill High School. In its second year, the number of students increased to 500 as Grade 11 courses were added. The 2007/2008 school year found the student population increased to 850 students, with Grade 12 being added. In May 2009, Richmond Green had approximately 1000 students, with new students arriving regularly due to new housing developments in Richmond Hill and Markham. As of October 2018, the population of the school is over 1,200. ==Clubs== *DECA Richmond Green Chapter, regional and provincial top finalists in business roleplay.
